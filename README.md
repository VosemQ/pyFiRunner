# pyFiRunner
 Keep all your python files in one location and run any at heart's will without having to look for them

## How To Use
 Just chuck all the python files you want to have run in a pyFiles folder in the same directory as the runFiles.py file!
 ### NOTE
  Python files not in the root pyFiles folder will NOT be shown in the menu, so feel free to put extra files which don't need to be ran by a human in a subfolder!
